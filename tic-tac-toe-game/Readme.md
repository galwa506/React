**Tic-Tac-Toe Game with React.js**

**Description:**
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.js. Players can take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their assigned symbol ('X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2) before their opponent does. The game features interactive components, move history tracking, and immutability of filled squares.

**Player Interactions:**
1. Player 1 is assigned 'X', and Player 2 is assigned 'O'.
2. Squares on the grid cannot be altered once filled.
3. Players have the option to review the history of their moves.

**React Concepts Covered:**
- Designing interactive components to enhance user experience.
- Employing state management for dynamic updates.
- Passing data efficiently through props.
- Emphasizing the importance of immutability for data integrity.
- Utilizing the technique of lifting state up to manage shared state.
- Integrating keys for optimal rendering and element identification.

**Usage:**
To run the game locally, clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`. Then, run `npm start` to launch the application in your browser.
